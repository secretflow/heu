msgid "HEU 的目的是降低同态加密的使用门槛，使得用户无需专业知识就能利用同态加密算法构建任意程序。"
msgstr ""
"HEU aims to simplify the use of homomorphic encryption (HE) for data "
"scientists. Particular care was given to the simplicity of our Python "
"package in order to make it usable by any data scientist, even those "

msgid "由于 HEU 还处在起步阶段，当前 HEU 仅仅是一个加法同态加密的 library，还不具备像 SPU 一样执行任意程序的能力。"
msgstr ""
"Since HEU is still in its infancy, HEU can only be used as a library and "
"it is not ready to execute arbitrary programs like SPU."
