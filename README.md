HEU (Homomorphic Encryption processing Unit) is a user-friendly and high-performance homomorphic
encryption library that supports multiple types and scalable hardware acceleration.

## Repo status

Homomorphic encryption algorithms are mainly divided into two categories: partially homomorphic
encryption (PHE) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Currently, HEU supports most PHE
algorithms, while FHE is still under development and will take some time.

Supported algorithms:

- Additive homomorphic encryption
    - Paillier (recommended)
    - Okamoto–Uchiyama (recommended)
    - EC ElGamal
    - Damgard-Jurik
    - Damgard-Geisler-Krøigaard (DGK)
- Fully homomorphic encryption
    - Under development and is the current focus of work.

Each algorithm includes a variety of different implementations, and some implementations support
hardware accelerators. For more details, please refer to
the [Document](https://www.secretflow.org.cn/docs/heu/latest/zh-Hans/getting_started/algo_choice )

```

HEU is currently transitioning from the old Dispatcher architecture to an SPI-based framework. The
main modules and their code path mappings for both architectures are as follows:

Dispatcher-based architecture:

```text
     Python APIs (Python binding)
          PATH: heu/pylib
                  │
                  ├───────────────────┐
                  │                   ▼
                  │    Tensor Lib with Numpy-like API
                  │        PATH: heu/library/numpy
                  │                   │
                  │     ┌─────────────┘

## Compile and install

### Environmental requirements

- CPU
    - x86_64: minimum required AVX instruction set
    - AArch64: ARMv8
- OS
    - Ubuntu 18.04+
    - Centos 7
    - macOS 11.1+ (macOS Big Sur+)<sup>1</sup>
- Python
    - Python 3.8+

1. Due to CI resource limitation, macOS x64 prebuild binary will no longer available since next release.

### Install via Pip

```shell
pip install sf-heu
```

### Install from source

The following command will automatically compile and install HEU into the default Python
environment:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:secretflow/heu.git
cd heu
sh build_wheel_entrypoint.sh

```

### Run unit tests (optional)





```shell
# just compile, do not run any UT (optional)
bazel build heu/...

# compile and run all UTs
bazel test heu/...
```
